# jBlog

This is my blog site that is based on the [Lagrange theme](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/). My blog is mostly dedicated to travel although I plan additional sections dedicated to other topics in the future.

If you want to read about my travels, please visit [my site](https://www.joshsoucie.com/jblog).
